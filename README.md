# DOOR_LOCK_RFID_KEYPAD
Project Description:

Designed a door lock system utilizing the ESP32 microcontroller, Arduino IDE, RFID, and keypad technologies.
The system enables secure access control by integrating both RFID and keypad authentication methods.
Users can gain entry by either scanning their authorized RFID card or entering a valid code using the keypad.
The ESP32 microcontroller processes the input data, validates it against pre-programmed credentials, and triggers the door lock mechanism if the authentication is successful. 
The Arduino IDE is utilized for programming the ESP32 and controlling the hardware components.
This project showcases my proficiency in embedded systems development, RFID technology integration, and Arduino programming.
